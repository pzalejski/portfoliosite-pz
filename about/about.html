            Piotr (Peter) Zalejski does not love talking about himself, let alone in the 3rd person. He is from Chicago, Illinois and is excited to be diving into the world of software development. He is married, and the father of a beautiful 7 year old girl. His family loves to ski in the winter and go boating during the summer. During his free time he is reading up on the latest technology and is a fan of rpg games.
